# Stack-Based Arithmetic Calculator
Created by Termie-dev

An arithmetic calculator implemented in Java using two array-based stacks that have an amortized time complexity of O(1).

## Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Supports power and inequality operations: greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to, equal to, and not equal to.
- Reads expressions from a file and writes results to an output file.
- Implements two array-based stacks to handle operations and variables with efficient amortized time complexity.
